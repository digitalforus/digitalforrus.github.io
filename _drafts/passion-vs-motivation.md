# Passion vs. Motivation

I spent a good part of my weekend playing video games on my computer. A really cool game called "[Papers, Please]" really grabbed my attention. It's a simple game but it's also an indy game. Someone who cares a hell of a lot about gaming decided to make a game and then sell it to the world. Critical reviews really like the game too.

As someone who frequently plays video games (but isn't rabid about them), I thought I'd dig in and try to learn how to create a game myself.

That's where the trouble started. I have an extremely high bar set for myself. I struggle with thinking what I'm building will be a crappy final product. I still fall back on "I'm not a" even though I'm [trying not to]. I'm highly motived, start figuring out my options, get caught in analysis paralysis, and then end up stopping when I think the result isn't something I can accomplish.

This workflow sucks. I struggle to determine if my problem is choosing to work on things that I'm not highly passionate about or if I'm merely lacking motivation (or both). The catch-22 of this is, to be perfectly honest, I'm not sure what I'm actually passionate about right now.

Over the past several years, I've let my guard down and have gotten caught up in the "production" of things and not the "creation" of things. It's a subtle difference. When the tools I currently have don't fit a potential problem I'd like to solve, I get caught up and inevitably flounder. In college I would tackle any sort of problem, nothing was too big to tackle. After years of software development, I feel particularly stunted.

In an attempt to break through this, I'm going to do a multitude of small projects that I **must** complete. Before, during, and after each project, I'm going to track how I felt while doing whatever the project was.

My hope is that this will help point me towards an area that I can be extremely passionate about. More importantly, I want to track if passion and motivation are intertwined or if motivation can be a sole culprit. Will I jump back into a project I'm passionate about faster than one I'm not?

This experiment may totally lie flat on it's face but it's a problem I'm convinced other people are having but no one is talking about. If you'd like to give me some tips, advice, or feedback, please [tweet me](http://twitter.com/kdaigle) or [email me](mailto:kyledaigle@gmail.com).
