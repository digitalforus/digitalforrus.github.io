<p>I&#8217;ve been reflecting on 2010 and short of actually coming up with resolutions I&#8217;ve found a way to improve in 2011. I think the biggest change I&#8217;d like to make isto change my focus.</p>
<p>I thought that multi-tasking was a skill that improves the amount of work we can accomplish, but especially in 2010, I&#8217;ve found it do a bit more harm than good. In manual or task oriented projects, multi-tasking has been great. It allows me to bounce between a few different pieces of the project, do some work, and then move on. But when it comes to creative thinking or problem solving, mult-tasking seems to have become a bit more of a curse than a blessing.</p>
<p>For Christmas, my wife got me &#8220;<a title="SoulPancake" target="_blank" href="http://amzn.com/1401310338?tag=kyledaigle-20">Soul Pancake</a>&#8221;, the book by Rainn Wilson and his team. It has helped me understand a bit of what I&#8217;ve lost. In the new year, I want to spend more allotted time simply being creative: treating it like a skillset instead of a tool you call upon. I&#8217;m calling this &#8220;The Analog Conversion&#8221;. Instead of being stuck in our digital ways of checking 7 websites, chatting with friends, getting SMSs, I want to be able to truly think through a problem, idea, or thought without either being distracted or letting my mind wander to distract itself.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ll be able to perform best in this conversion with some sort of framework. I intend to keep updating this as I go through the process, but I&#8217;m going to start with bullet points, I guess.</p>
<ul><li>Spend a pointed effort to mono-task whenever possible. If you&#8217;re playing a video game, shut your laptop. If you&#8217;re watching TV, just watch TV. Stop having two active activities going on simultaneously. My hope is this will provide me with more &#8220;usable&#8221; time without guilt of wasting time away.</li>
<li>Engage in more creative production. For me, I think this will mean one purposefully creative block of thinking during the day. Writing, coding, sketching, white boarding. Doing something that is producing.</li>
<li>Engage in more creative consumption. I think its important to break the two apart as consuming someone else&#8217;s creativity, while important, is only one side of the coin. Reading a fiction book, an editorial, looking at some art/sketches. Its important here, especially for me, to be sure that you entirely engage with what you&#8217;re trying to consume.</li>
</ul><p>I figure these three bullet points are a good start for the manifesto. I don&#8217;t intend to shut out the digital world because, to be honest, that wouldÂ never really work. But I intend to change how I use it.</p>
<p>I know some of the (few) followers of this blog might be annoyed of the non-technical slant, but I think even for developers coding is a means of creative expression. Its one tool we have to create something. For me, I&#8217;ve found, coding provides me an outlet for this expression but I can more about the expression than the tool. But having a bunch of tools definitely helps.</p>
