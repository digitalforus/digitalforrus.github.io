<p><span>As I was working on my creative project on Sunday, I began to realize something as I was banging my head against the wall. I reached a point where I was getting nowhere. I couldn&#8217;t figure out why the piece of code I was working with didn&#8217;t work the way I expected. Every fiber of my being was telling me to just stop. Stop, take a break, it isn&#8217;t worth it, deal with it later. That&#8217;s when it hit me.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Persistence and perseverance are skills to train.</span></strong></p>
<p>When I say it and read it, I think it probably makes a ton of sense. But I think we&#8217;re forced to deal with a ton of situations throughout the day where &#8220;I&#8217;ll just stop for a few minutes&#8221; sounds like a great way to do deal with your problem. But some of the biggest triumphs and breakthroughs come from pushing that giant boulder back up the hill.</p>

<p>I love the story of <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus">Sisyphus</a> pushing the bolder up the hill. My immediate reaction when I started getting annoyed with the task in front of me was to actually start adding distractions. I can recognize this now that I&#8217;m done. I turned on the TV, I started poking through email every few seconds like somehow that would help. But I remembered one of the main points of my Analog Conversion Manifesto was to simply add more focus. So I did.</p>
<p>I shut off my desktop computer. I shut off email and nearly every application except the two I was using. I put some music on I was very familiar with and dug back in. A few moments later, BAM, breakthrough. I got what I needed and was totally in the zone.</p>
<p>So the next time you&#8217;re totally befuddled by a piece of code, a task at work, or a handy-man project at home, try to <strong>focus your efforts further by removing even <em>more</em> distractions.</strong> It won&#8217;t always help, but its one step in the right direction.</p>
