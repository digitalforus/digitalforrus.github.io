<p>I started this adventure when I realized I was overweight. Well, overweight is how I like to say it as technically I&#8217;m obese (thanks, BMI). I initially started with a *very* aggressive diet plan that I won&#8217;t name. At the time I was telling myself that I wasn&#8217;t going for the get think quick plan, but I really was. I found the rules VERY difficult to follow especially when it comes to traveling for work. So I inevitably lasted about a week&#8230; and then had to give up.</p>
<p>Then on some advice of my wife, I found an amazing diet plan. I&#8217;m going to spend the rest of this post covering some of the amazing tools that I&#8217;ve found that have worked really well for me, but also share some of the insights I&#8217;ve come to learn.</p>

<p>This diet plan has been absolutely amazing. While calling it a diet is sort of a misnomer (its really just healthy eating), it was able to do what a lot of other books, diets, plans were unable to do for me: create a realistic set of goals. The Best Life Diet is broken down into three phases: Getting Started, Digging Deeper, and Life Long Maintenance. It has a set of simple rules that are laid out like &#8220;no white bread&#8221; or &#8220;no soda&#8221; to start with. To start with in Phase One, there are only 6 rules you need to follow.</p>
<p>I personally love &#8220;rules&#8221;. I think its much easier to make healthy food choices when you have a set of guidelines instead of merely telling yourself, &#8220;I&#8217;ll just eat healthier.&#8221; The book breaks down how some &#8220;healthy&#8221; foods sneak around as very un-healthy ones. (Did you know that even if a box says 0&#160;g trans-fat it can have up to .49&#160;g of trans fat?)</p>

<p>I thought this book was quite helpful. Part of the &#8220;Best Life Diet&#8221; is to increase your activity. What I usually do when it comes down to this is to start running&#8230; too much. I&#8217;m not physically fit as it is so running for a mile or two all of a sudden will do me little good but tire me out and make me stop faster. &#8220;Run Your Butt Off&#8221; covers a bit of a &#8220;walk to run&#8221; program: <strong>the idea that getting active is the most important part of a new exercise routine</strong>. Don&#8217;t set unrealistic goals for yourself, thats the easiest way to fail. Instead, set very realistic goals&#8230; walking for 5 minutes, then running for 1, all the way up to running for 45 minutes straight. I&#8217;ve also used other plans online but this is the best book I could find that covers the process.</p>
<p>In another post, I will cover a few of the devices and iPhone apps that I&#8217;ve been using as well.</p>
