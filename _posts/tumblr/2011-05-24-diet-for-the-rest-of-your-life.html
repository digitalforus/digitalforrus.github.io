<p>Thats the question I think you need to ask yourself when you start a diet or fitness program. Most people think to themselves, &#8220;Oh I can do diet X for the next 4 months to lose my weight.&#8221; The first major problem with this is obvious: <strong>diets don&#8217;t produce results when you aren&#8217;t on them.</strong></p>
<p><a title="Life ring by DanBrady, on Flickr" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/djbrady/1460272108/" target="_blank"><img alt="Life ring" height="333" width="500" src="http://farm2.static.flickr.com/1018/1460272108_67d45ad621.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>If your diet is a temporary choice, you will lose weight (most likely) up until you stop doing it. Then when you go back to your normal eating habits, you&#8217;ll regain the weight and lose all your gains.</p>
<p>Thats why diets don&#8217;t really work for most people. &#8220;No carb&#8221;, &#8220;High protein&#8221;, &#8220;All liquid&#8221; diets can work temporarily (at this point, I&#8217;m ignoring the nutritional issues with some of these) but if you do &#8220;no carb&#8221; can you really tell yourself you&#8217;ll never have bread the rest of your life? I doubt it.</p>
<p>The same goes for your fitness strategy. I&#8217;ve had several friends do P90X and fall off the wagon. I think this, again, is relatively simple: while a program like P90X can provide rapid results do you have the willpower to do it the rest of your life? I&#8217;ve personally never done the program, but it sounds like after doing a day of it you wish you were at the end of your life.</p>
<p><strong>Its important to choose small steps that you can continue doing for the rest of your life.</strong>Â If you make incremental improvements, you can build and build and build until you reach the point where you answer &#8220;this is the most I can do for the rest of my life&#8221;.</p>
<p>For me, this ends with two choices: following the Best Life diet (a list of healthy eating guidelines essentially) and upping my activity levels. As I&#8217;ve written in my other post, I knew that running too much would likely kick me off the wagon. So I took small jumps&#8230; run a few more this week and then lift a few more the next week. At some point, I&#8217;ll realize that I&#8217;ve reached my fitness plateau. I can blast a bit more in the short term to make gains I won&#8217;t be able to sustain more than that plateau.</p>
<p>So now that we&#8217;re coming up to beach season, think about your diets as a choice during those hard times: holidays, five years from now, vacations. While its OK to bend the rules, these aren&#8217;t rules until you meet your goal they are rules for your best life.</p>
