<p>My friends Peter &amp; Christine suggested we try to make our home-made pizza on the grill instead of the pizza stone. It was a great success! I&#8217;m going to replicate their strategy here to share but ultimately it is their recipe (so thanks to them).</p>
<p><strong>Grilled Home-made Pizza</strong></p>
<ul><li>Whole Wheat Pizza Dough (pre-made; ours is from Whole Foods)</li>
<li>Olive Oil (we did flavored Oregano Olive Oil)</li>
<li>Your toppings (cheese, tomato sauce, veggies, meats, etc.)</li>
</ul><ol><li>Heat up your grill on low or medium-low depending on the grill.</li>
<li>Before putting it on the grill, allow your pizza dough to come to room temperature. Spread it out nice and thin. I did it on a cookie sheet. If you have a pizza stone, it should be larger than it (probably rectangular). You only want it about 1/4&#8221; or less in thickness. Spreading it out to cover the entire cookie sheet worked well.</li>
<li>Spread olive oil on the top of the dough.</li>
<li>Place your pizza dough on the grill, oil side down. Shut the grill and allow it to crisp for 4 minutes.</li>
<li>Flip the dough over on the grill. On this side, place your ingredients. For us, that was tomato sauce, cheese, and prosciutto (in that order). If you do cheese, you do want it to be on as early on in the process as possible (so it melts well).</li>
<li>Allow it to finish cooking and crisp for 4 to 5 minutes. Be sure to watch the bottom of the crust so it doesn&#8217;t get too brown. Keep the grill closed as much as possible so that the cheese melts.</li>
</ol><p>We thought this was absolutely delicious and can&#8217;t wait to try it again. Thanks again to Pete &amp; Christine for the great suggestion.</p>
