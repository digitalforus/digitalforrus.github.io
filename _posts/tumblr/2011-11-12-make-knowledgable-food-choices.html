<p>My buddy Jeff sent me a tweet earlier today from OMGFacts that got me thinking (and probably not in the way you&#8217;d expect):</p>
<p><img src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_luk10s9Zwt1qz7yy3.png"/></p>
<p>Yes, the Snickers fact is true and so is the cheeseburger fact. This actually comes from a <a target="_blank" href="http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/02/22/how-to-make-oatmeal-wrong/">NY Times article</a> that annoyed me just as much. It completely misses the point.</p>
<p>When I started my diet, I used a book called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-Life-Diet-Revised-Updated/dp/B002PJ4I52/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321112803&amp;sr=1-1">The Best Life Diet</a> which is ultimately a set of rules on what to eat. I followed up with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.amazon.com/Food-Rules-Eaters-Michael-Pollan/dp/014311638X/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1321112774&amp;sr=8-1">Michael Pollan&#8217;s &#8220;Food Rules&#8221;</a> which covers some simple rules on what to eat. But ultimately it all boils down to a few facts:</p>
<ol><li>A calorie is not a calorie is not a calorie.</li>
<li>You need to know what is in your food and their key nutritional facts.</li>
<li>Make the best food choice you can make given a situation.</li>
</ol><p>Several studies came out this year describing that the normal thought of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nutritionj.com/content/3/1/9">&#8220;calorie is a calorie&#8221;</a> is not longer true. You cannot measure only calories in your fight to lose weight or get healthy.</p>
<p>While the McDonald&#8217;s oatmeal (which I do eat when I travel) has roughly the same number of calories as a Cheeseburger from McDonalds, I do not recommend you just have a cheeseburger instead. Why? Look at the nutrition facts: the cheeseburger has way more fat, a bunch more saturated fat, far less fiber, no vitamins from the fruit, but&#8230; equal calories. Given a travel choice, the Oatmeal should come out on top every time.</p>
<p>The McDonald&#8217;s oatmeal does have <a target="_blank" href="http://nutrition.mcdonalds.com/nutrition1/itemDetailInfo.do?itemID=1500">some weird issues</a> with it though. For example, the light cream that they put into the Oatmeal has a ton of ingredients that aren&#8217;t actually&#8230; well&#8230; cream or dairy. Yes, you can leave it out, but my point here is to be informed. McDonald&#8217;s oatmeal could be just oatmeal. One ingredient: whole food oatmeal. So making oatmeal at home is better for you than going to McDonald&#8217;s but if you&#8217;ve looking for a good travel food, the oatmeal is a good example of making a knowledgeable choice while traveling.</p>
<p>Not all good-for-you food is created equal though. Dunkin Donuts has a Multigrain bagel that actually has more calories and a few more worse-for-you ingredients compared to a normal bagel. A breakfast bagel from Dunkin could cost you about 450 - 500 calories with cream cheese. Or a Subway lunch: take a read on your meats and bread. Their bread has high fructose corn syrup in it which really bothers my stomach. Its important to learn a lot about the food you eat just so choosing the &#8220;healthy thing&#8221; doesn&#8217;t turn out being the a worse-for-you.</p>
<p>Home-made oatmeal is better than McDonald&#8217;s oatmeal but don&#8217;t try to tell me that instead of the McDonald&#8217;s Oatmeal I should eat a Snickers or a McDonald&#8217;s Cheeseburger</p>
