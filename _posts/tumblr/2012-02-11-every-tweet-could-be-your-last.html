title: Every Tweet Could Be Your Last

<p>For the past several weeks, I&#8217;ve been pretty quickly re-evaluating my social media intake. It&#8217;s one of the moves I&#8217;m taking to stop consuming so much and start producing more.</p>
<p>I started off by using <a href="http://www.unsubscribe.com" target="_blank">Unsubscribe</a> (an awesome service) to remove myself from a metric-crap-ton of newsletters I&#8217;ve been receiving. I&#8217;m as close to Inbox Zero as I have ever been.</p>
<p>Then came Twitter. I love Twitter. I use Twitter the most out of all the networks I&#8217;m on. I&#8217;m pretty passive on Facebook and basically non-existant on LinkedIn. But Twitter? I love my Twitter. But I&#8217;ve decided to essentially look at every tweet and evaluate it with the following process:</p>
<ol><li>Did reading this tweet do anything for me at all?</li>
<li>If yes, continue to follow this person.</li>
<li>If no, can you remember the last tweet the person/company did? If yes, continue to follow this person.</li>
<li>If you can&#8217;t remember the last tweet and this tweet isn&#8217;t doing anything for you, it&#8217;s likely the tweet is one of the following: social media/self promoting bullshit, something that I do not need to/want to know about, your original content to retweet ratio is far too high, or &#8220;who are you again?&#8221;</li>
</ol><p>If you&#8217;ve made it to step 4, you&#8217;re getting un-followed. Please do not take it personally (I know thats basically impossible if we actually know each other in real life). We all consume far too much information: let&#8217;s at least make the information we consume worthwhile.</p>
