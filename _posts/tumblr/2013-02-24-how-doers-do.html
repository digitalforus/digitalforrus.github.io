<p>Yesterday, while I was poking around on Twitter, I came across an article by Josh Long <a href="http://joshlong.me/articles/kill-your-heroes/" target="_blank">describing how to kill your heroes</a>. Basically, go out there and do something worthwhile and stop regaling your heroes for their ability to shut up and ship.</p>
<p>In a perfect example, Tom Preston-Werner of Github fame reminded us what it&#8217;s like to ship. After letting his project <a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll" target="_blank">jekyll</a> get a little heavy with pull requests and issues, it appears as though he was dedicating his Saturday to getting things back in order.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">

<p>In the past few weeks, Rails has been plagued with a few YAML security issues. It&#8217;s generally accepted that YAML is an annoying tool to use but it&#8217;s the defacto way to share configuration in Ruby right now. But Tom doesn&#8217;t care.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>YAML gives me rage. So much complexity. Urge to design own format RISING.</p>

<p>And, just like that, instead of complaining in a tweet, instead of writing a blog post about how it should work, or instead of whining on a pull request somewhere, he decided to <strong>forward the conversation by doing something</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>TOML IS IMMINENT.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p>I&#8217;m actually writing the TOML spec right now, I AM NOT JOKING.</p>

<p>Dont try and talk me out of this. It will only fuel the awesome. Almost done, anyway.</p>

<p>In roughly two hours from his initial &#8220;YAML rage&#8221; tweet, he had his specification for his suggestion on a better option to YAML.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-cards="hidden">
<p>Introducing TOML. Never use YAML again. Yep, I went there. <a href="https://t.co/FwkHD1S9eF" title="https://github.com/mojombo/toml" target="_blank">github.com/mojombo/toml</a></p>

<script charset="utf-8" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" type="text/javascript"></script><p>Wether or not you agree with Tom that YAML is bad and wether or not you like TOML, it&#8217;s one thing to write &#8220;we ship all day&#8221; or &#8220;just up and ship&#8221; in a blog post or in your Twitter bio. But it&#8217;s a totally different class of hacker who writes they hate this tool they&#8217;re using and then immediately releases their suggestion.</p>
<p>I still have a long way to go before this flow is so ingrained in me that it&#8217;s second nature. I&#8217;ve made some <a href="https://github.com/kdaigle/strapper" target="_blank">recent strides recently with Strapper</a>. However, watching this unfold over Twitter last night was too good to not learn from.</p>
