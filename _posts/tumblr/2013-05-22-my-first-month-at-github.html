<p>This past Monday marked my first month at GitHub. It&#8217;s been an amazing experience. Instead of writing a long post, I&#8217;m going to try to boil it down to some of the highlights.</p>
<ul><li>I joined a new team with <a href="http://theprogrammingbutler.com" target="_blank">Jon Hoyt</a>. I&#8217;ll be working on business tools for the GitHub business folks starting with solving problems for the amazing finance team.</li>
<li>There are so many smart, talented, funny, and fun to be around people at GitHub. It&#8217;s one hell of a super hero team.</li>
<li>I&#8217;ve attended more baseball games in the last month than in the last 26 years of my life. The Giants are now my west coast team. (I still hold a special place in my heart for the Red Sox though.)</li>
<li>Everything you hear GitHub speak about is entirely true. One of my biggest questions when interviewing was &#8220;what&#8217;s the catch&#8221;. Thus far, it&#8217;s even better than it appears on the outside.</li>
<li>My programming ability is improving at an incredible velocity. Everyone wants to help you, your code, your application, and your team ship beautiful code. (Emphasis on the ship.)</li>
</ul><p>I&#8217;m excited to see where my first year takes me. This is going to be one hell of a year.</p>
