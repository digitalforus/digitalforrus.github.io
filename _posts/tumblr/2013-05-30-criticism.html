<p>I started reading an <a href="http://dcurt.is/glass" target="_blank">article by Dustin Curtis</a> this morning. He discusses criticisms about Google Glass and the &#8220;fundamental&#8221; challenges ambient computing devices face. Dustin makes some great points in the article and I recommend you read it.</p>
<p>There is something about recent criticism that has gotten under my skin. The internet has made everyone a critic and we have very little to show for it. (The irony of my criticism is not lost on me here.)</p>
<p>I went to college to study theatre. Criticism is in my blood. I can give it (well) and I can take it (slightly less well). But the internet has shifted the balance of criticism to a simple binary choice: you have exceeded all expectations or you are discardable.</p>
<p>The iPhone tackled something that could have failed so spectacularly. It defined a new class of device, a new class of user interaction. It was beautiful, but flawed. It was flawed, but forgiven.</p>
<p>But sometime after the iPhone, everything changed. I&#8217;m not sure what about the iPhone allowed it to be so forgiven given it&#8217;s obvious initial flaws. People hated its slower internet, its carrier lock-in, and its lack of a physical keyboard. But, despite all these flaws, the iPhone succeeded brilliantly.</p>
<p>My fear for the future isn&#8217;t that we won&#8217;t have jet packs or awesome self-driving cars. It&#8217;s that people are going to be less likely to try things and fail spectacularly at them. It&#8217;s that college students won&#8217;t try to do something laughable and potentially laudable. This isn&#8217;t fetishism about failing. It&#8217;s about following a path to the very end, regrouping, and finding an entirely new path to continue on.</p>
<p>Strong criticism drives us towards exceptional work. Journalists and critics have an important place in our culture. But criticism needs to drive more questions like &#8220;where can we go from here&#8221; instead of &#8220;why did we end up at our destination&#8221;.</p>
<p>The early reviews of Google Glass show a far less than perfect product but I&#8217;m excited to see the consequences of them launching it. Google is spearheading legal issues, usability patterns, wearable industrial design, and a whole host of other interesting, complicated problems. While our wearable ambient computing savior may not come from Google, I&#8217;m happy they decided to try to tackle this problem.</p>
<p>Google Glass may not be the answer. The answer may lie down another path whose trailhead is only visible now that we&#8217;ve made it this far.</p>
